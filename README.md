# MICROSOFT VENTURES INTO THE WORLD OF FILM INDUSTRY.

## Introduction

This is a Data Science Project for the Microsoft company, on analyzing the film trends, seeking to venture into studio making process. Microsoft plans to make use of its background in the craft of cinematic storytelling, which has a track record of revolutionizing technology and influencing how people interact. In a field historically driven by audience preferences, trends, and innovation, Microsoft brings a wealth of technical experience, data analytics, and in-depth understanding of consumer behavior to the table. 

## Business Problem

Microsoft sees all the big companies creating original video content and they want to get in on the fun. They have decided to create a new movie studio, but they donâ€™t know anything about creating movies. You are charged with exploring what types of films are currently doing the best at the box office. You must then translate those findings into actionable insights that the head of Microsoft's new movie studio can use to help decide what type of films to create.

## Business Understanding
The film business is a dynamic and ever-changing market with several chances for growth and innovation. Microsoft's entry into this space is intended to reach a different audience section and culture, than its conventional technology-focused client base. It is an opportunity to rebrand the corporation as a forward-thinking entity that excels at creative storytelling and entertainment, rather than just a tech giant. 

## The Data

These are movie datasets from:

* [Box Office Mojo](https://www.boxofficemojo.com/)
* [Rotten Tomatoes](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/)
* [TheMovieDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/)
* [The Numbers](https://www.the-numbers.com/)

## Methodology
The project was written in python using jupyter notebook to analyze data from different sources to showcase budgets, performance of various movies and their popularity all together. Steps taken in analyzing the data were:
                                                1. Loading the datasets using pandas
                                                2. Cleaning the datasets by removing null values
                                                3. Viewing different perspectives of the datasets respectively
                                                4. Merging different datasets
                                                5. Plotting visuals using matplotlib and seaborn

## Conclusions:
Throughout this whole project, great discoveries about the world of film and the movie industry were uncovered. Some of the conclusions made were; Production of films through the IFC Studio garnered the highest number, Films with a runtime of an average of eighty-five minutes are highly recommended and as the time passes, films gain more popularity with the people. This is mostly accredited to the advancements and the ever-changing world of technology that we live in. 

## Recommendations:
From the findings made, I would propose that Microsoft joins the film industry through a distribution model such as IFC, Warner Bros and Fox because more top movies may be made at a lesser cost than making an original picture, which is what major film studios do. I would also propose that when making a film, it should pick a runtime of an average of eighty-five minutes in order to get more views and thus better ratings.
